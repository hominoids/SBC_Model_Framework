# SBC Model Framework

## Introduction

This project is a lightweight and dynamic framework for the generation of SBC and micro-controller models written in OpenSCAD.

SBC Model Framework provides 3D models of SBC, MCU, Compute Modules and Carrier Boards.  In addition, the framework allows for the automatic generation of IO mask sets to use for creating corresponding device openings.  This includes support for multiple masks for individual components that can be altered by shape and projection to cover a wide range of needs. Technical meta-data is also implemented to store device characteristics for reference and design purposes.


### Current Library

```
                  SBC:  82
       Carrier Boards:   4
      Compute Modules:   9
    Micro Controllers:   9
Standard Motherboards:  14
           Custom PCB:   1
        Total Devices: 116
```

## Using SBC Model Framework

Any of the models can be called by passing the requested SBC model in the form of sbc("model"). Command line options allow for the control of the SBC's heatsink and mask, GPIO and mask, UART mask and component masks. The heatsink fan mask size can be changed to allow for the use of different fan sizes from 30mm-92mm.

```
include <sbc_models.scad>
sbc("rpi5");
```

```

There are 13 different command line options for the heatsink:

```
"disable" - turns off the heatsink model and mask
"off" - heatsink model is off, mask is on and default will be used when called.
"default" - heatsink model is on and uses the mask setting stored in sbc_models.cfg
"none" - heatsink model is on and mask is off.
"open", "fan_open", "fan_1", "fan_2", "fan_hex",
"vent", "vent_hex_5mm", "vent_hex_8mm", "custom" - to use specific mask
```

There are 8 different command line options for the GPIO:

```
"disable" - turns off the GPIO model and mask
"off" - GPIO model is off, mask is on and default will be used when called.
"default" - GPIO model is on and uses the mask setting stored in sbc_models.cfg
"none" - GPIO model is on and mask is off.
"open", "block", "knockout", "vent" - to use specific mask
```

There are 4 different command line options for the UART:

```
"default" - UART model is on and uses the mask setting stored in sbc_models.cfg
"none" - UART model is on and mask is off.
"open", "knockout" - to use specific mask
```

To call the 3D model or mask set

```
enablemask - false produces 3D model, true produces IO mask set
```

## SBC Model and Component Viewer

The sbc_models_viewer has a Customizer UI and can be used to examine individual devices in the library, all of them at once or the component classes and types.  It has the follow features:

- Display SBC, MCU and CM Models
- Device Technical Information Access
- 5-way 2D Sections for DXF export
  - PCB shape with PCB and GPIO Holes
  - Rear, Front, Left and Right Sides
- Console text list of PCB size and PCB hole locations and uses
- 3D Reference Manual with Component Classes, Types and model.

The information display requires a monospaced font for proper presentation.  Several of the common open-source monospaced fonts are included in the pickbox under the Customizer UI.  Verify what fonts are installed and recognized by the system using the menu selection **Help->Font List**.  Any installed monospaced font can be used by updating the *text_font* variable on line 36.

## Adding Devices

The framework is setup so that SBC, MCU and CM can be easily added or modified and the resulting models can be used regardless of the state of completion. The framework consists of three parts, the SBC data set (sbc_models.cfg), the main module(sbc_models.scad) and a library of components(sbc_library.scad).

All devices are described in sbc_models.cfg, an ASCII file that can be modified with any text editor. It contains commands for the description of a given SBC model using the following schema:

class, type, pcbid, loc_x, loc_y, loc_z, face, [rotation], [size_x, size_y, size_z], [data_1, data_2...], [mask]

A device is defined by using the commands *pcb* and *pcbhole* to define the PCB shape and hole locations.  Each PCB in a device description is uniquely identified by the *pcb_id*.  All commands that share the same pcb_id are associated to that PCB which allows for multi-PCB devices such as an SBC that is comprised of two PCB or a compute module and it's carrier board. Each device entry in the file sbc_models.cfg must have as it's first entries:

- *device_model* - unique key identifying device
- *pcb_info[]* - device information array
- *pcb* - class entry for the first PCB in the device

SBC Model Viewer can be used to view the new pcb by adding its unique name to the array on line 30 of sbc_model_viewer.scad which is used to populate the pick box of all known devices. Restarting the application since the OpenSCAD Customizer does not support dynamic changes to the user interface.
  
The remainder of the entries describing a device can be in any order.

...
]
```

The next step is to populate the SBC model's configuration entry with it's components.  There are approximately 35 Classes of components with many having several types or parametric parameters to produce different sizes, genders or other features. The asterisk in the Component Classes and Types table below indicate use classes that have one or more masks for openings - component types that are parametric have parametric masks.

### Component Entries
The first eight data entries are used by all components and describe the Class, Type, XYZ Location, PCB Side and Rotation for component placement.  The size[] and data[] arrays are used by some but not all components and their specific uses for each Class-Type can be found in the Class and Type Reference section below.

### Component Mask
A Component's mask for using I/O openings is set in the mask array through the following variables:
```
mask[0] = enable component mask (true, false)
mask[1] = length in mm
mask[2] = set back in mm
mask[3] = mstyle ("default")
```
The first mask array entry enables or disables that individual components mask.  If it is set to false all mask generation will be overridden.  The second mask variable length, sets the distance the mask will be projected to create an opening.  The third variable determines the setback.  Image a HDMI-A component that overhangs the PCB by 2mm.  If the mask opening starts at the face of the connector, there might not be an opening created because the face of the connector is beyond the wall.  The setback addresses this by pulling the mask backwards so an opening is created.  For the GPIO class only, the setback raises and lowers the opening instead of adjusting the setback.  The last entry in the mask array determines which mask to use if more then one is available.  All entries should indicate the *"default"* mask unless a specific mask is needed.  Some components, like heatsinks and GPIO, have many masks associated with them.

### Multi-PCB Devices
Multi-PCB devices are handled the same way as any other device, each PCB having a unique *pcb_id* that all it's components will share. The *pcb_id* zero will be the first PCB for all devices in the library and must be the first entry in the devices components.

## Accuracy

In the past there was been no way of validating whether a SBC Model Framework model and it’s components were accurate in their dimensions and placement other then trial and error. SBC Case Builder provides a model validation tool to assure model accuracy thru the use of test cases. It works on the very simple premise that if the real SBC fits the test case then the virtual model is accurate or otherwise shows were corrections are needed. This will further increased the overall accuracy of models.

Some SBC in SBC Model Framework may not have been validated or are missing component data and may produce one or more aspects of a case incorrectly. SBC status is noted in sbc.png and at the beginning of the SBC entry defined in sbc_models.cfg, as a part of SBC Model Framework. The color coded indicator of an SBC’s verification and completion as indicated in sbc.png is as follows:
```
GREEN = verified to be correct using SBC Case Builder.
YELLOW = unverified, mostlikely usable and/or missing minor information.
ORANGE = unverified, may be usable but missing component data.
RED = unverified, not usable due to incomplete component data.
```
The SBC that I do not own have been created using manufacturer supplied mechanical drawings, 3D models or have been contributed by another user. Some of the OEM drawings are missing information or have errors that effect all or part of the subsequent SBC models. If you own an SBC that is not represented or verified in SBC Model Framework, please consider adding it or helping to verify existing SBC data. An SBC can be verified to be accurate if a printed shell case from SBC Case Builder fits. Any misalignment is corrected in the SBC Model Framework model data(sbc_models.cfg).  PR's or other means of communication with corrections are much appreciated and needed to work towards 100% SBC model verification.  Please contribute if you can.
